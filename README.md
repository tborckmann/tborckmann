## 👋 Hi, I'm Till

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I’m an apiring developer from Germany, currently exploring the world of software engineering.
I finished school in summer 2025 and will be enrolling in university in **summer 2026** to study **Wirtschaftsinformatik (Business Informatics)**. 

&#8203;

## ⭐ Featured Projects

Here are some of my favorite projects that reflect what I enjoy working on:

### **Bot.exe** &#8203; ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=white) 
A multifunctional Discord bot built with Python to explore API communication, asynchronous workflows, and automation.  
Instead of focusing on a single purpose, the bot acts as a playground for features such as command handling, chat utilities, and basic moderation tools.

**Skills:** API usage, async programming, clean command structure, automation logic, UX

### **Ludo-3D-Unity** &#8203; ![Unity](https://img.shields.io/badge/Unity-000000?style=flat&logo=unity&logoColor=white) ![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%23-239120?style=flat&logo=csharp&logoColor=white) 
A full 3D remake of the classic board game *Ludo*, created in Unity.
The project challenged me to combine game logic, 3D interaction, and visual clarity while keeping gameplay close to the original experience. It features turn-based logic, smooth movement, UI elements, and basic CPU players.

**Skills:** game architecture, 3D object interaction, UI design, state handling, simple AI behavior

### **Sorting-Visualization** &#8203; ![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-ED8B00?style=flat&logo=openjdk&logoColor=white)
A Java desktop application that visualizes how different sorting algorithms operate internally.
Instead of just printing results, the project focuses on showing *why* algorithms behave differently - in speed, structure, and movement patterns. Ideal for both learning and teaching.

**Skills:** algorithm implementation, data visualization, UI programming

## 🚀 What I’m Interested In & What’s Next

I’m continuously improving my programming skills while diving deeper into **cyber security** and **application development**.
I’m will continue to build more projects - ideally ones that mix interesting logic, real-world utility, and maybe even security-relevant functionality.

If you have any questions or just want to chat, feel absolutely free to contact me.
Thanks for stopping by! 😊
